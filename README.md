## Summary:

In conclusion, the bike share data analyzed in Tableau demonstrated great insight into how a bike rideshare in a significant city does from a business perspective. Understanding some key points, such as older males being the primary customer for the business and the peak hours as well as areas that are most trafficked, gives investors an idea of how this can be viable in another city. In conducting further research, it would be helpful to understand where riders start and stop. This could help ensure a fair number of bikes in the highest trafficked areas. Another point of interest is to analyze where most of the subscribers in the city are. This can help develop a marketing strategy to gain more subscribers.
